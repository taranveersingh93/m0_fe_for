# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
=5/5

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
=That felt comfortable. No unproductive struggling. Couple of errors in code syntax but that was instantly fixed.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
= I feel comfortable. No calendar adjustments needed.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
= I'm aware there are more loop methods. Is there a reason why we use "for" loop?
